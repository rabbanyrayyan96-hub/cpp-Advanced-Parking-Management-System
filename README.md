# cpp-Advanced-Parking-Management-System
An application that simulates a parking management system in a multi-story building with several zones (Regular, EV, VIP). The application fully implements OOP: inheritance for vehicle/slot types, overriding/overloading for rate calculations and operations, polymorphism for heterogeneous collections, and neat exception handling.
